            <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
                <p>OCD is characterized by the presence of obsessions, compulsions, or both. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images experienced as intrusive and unwanted, causing distress. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts performed in response to an obsession or rigidly applied rules, aimed at preventing or reducing anxiety/distress.</p>
                <h3 class="sub-section-title text-2xl font-medium mt-6">Diagnostic Criteria Highlights:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Obsessions:</strong> Recurrent/persistent intrusive thoughts, urges, or images; attempts to ignore/suppress them or neutralize with compulsions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compulsions:</strong> Repetitive behaviors (e.g., hand washing, checking) or mental acts (e.g., praying, counting) performed in response to obsessions or rigid rules.</li>
                    <li>Obsessions or compulsions are time-consuming (more than 1 hour/day) or cause clinically significant distress/impairment.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="sub-section-title text-2xl font-medium mt-6">Associated Features:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>Sensory phenomena (physical sensations, "just-right" feelings) often precede compulsions.</li>
                    <li>Avoidance of triggers. Dysfunctional beliefs like inflated sense of responsibility and overestimation of threats.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="sub-section-title text-2xl font-medium mt-6">Prevalence & Risk Factors:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li>12-month prevalence in the US is 1.2%.</li>
                    <li>Women are slightly more affected in adulthood; men more common in childhood.</li>
                    <li>Risk factors include greater internalizing symptoms, negative emotionality, behavioral inhibition, adverse perinatal events, childhood abuse/trauma.</li>
                    <li>Genetic factors: approx. 2x risk for first-degree relatives. Dysfunction in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum implicated.</li>
                    <li>High comorbidity with anxiety and depressive disorders.</li>
                    <li>Associated with suicidal ideation and attempts (mean lifetime suicide attempts of 14.2%).</li>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title text-2xl font-medium mt-6">Psychological Causal Factors:</h3>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Mowrer's Two-Process Theory:</strong> Neutral stimuli associated with frightening thoughts (classical conditioning), and compulsions reduce anxiety (reinforcement).</li>
                    <li><strong>Preparedness:</strong> Obsessions about dirt/contamination may have evolutionary roots.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive Factors:</strong> Difficulty suppressing unwanted thoughts (paradoxical increase), inflated sense of responsibility, thought-action fusion (thinking a sin is morally equivalent to doing it). Low confidence in memory contributes to repetitive behaviors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Neurotransmitters:</strong> Increased serotonin activity and sensitivity of brain structures to serotonin, also involvement of dopaminergic, GABA, and glutamate systems.</li>
